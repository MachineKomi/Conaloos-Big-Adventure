## 2026-05-08 — Second pass (assets in flight)

**Touched:** `src/content/scenes.js`, `src/content/characters.js`, `docs/characters/*`, `docs/scenes/*`, `docs/THEME_COVERAGE.md`.

**Added:**
- Hand-authored scene definitions for all four backgrounds that landed: `sunny-rocket-garden` (HUB), `cosy-cottage-interior`, `mountain-lake-childlike`, `mountain-lake-vista`. Each has 6–9 hotspots with 3+ rhyming responses, themes, and at least one portal.
- Bios + 5 sample lines for every character that landed: Conaloo (bear-butterly), Monaloo (butterfly), Seesa (pink bee), Cofeenie + Lucy (Queen-of-Rabbits-Twin), Pepsi (dog-thing), Amelia (F4), Cosenae (M5), Lulumi (F14), mommy, daddy.
- Tiny Museum hotspots filling the three empty themes: `countdown` and `trade` in the garden (numbers + economics), `tea` and `shelf` in the cottage (economics + cs), `pebbles` at the lake (numbers), `notebook` at the vista (cs).
- `applyDisplaySize` helper in `GameScene` so sprites size relative to viewport height (`heightFrac`) — needed because source PNGs are 2048×2048 and explicit scale multipliers were producing huge sprites.
- Default hub preference list now favours `sunny-rocket-garden`.
- `BootScene` data-passing fixed: Phaser calls `init(data)` automatically when a scene starts, so `onReady` is now passed via `game.scene.add('boot', BootScene, true, { onReady })` instead of being mutated on the instance (which Phaser was clobbering).

**Theme coverage status:** every theme in GDD §8 now has ≥2 hotspots somewhere. See `docs/THEME_COVERAGE.md`.

**Open hooks for next agent / next session:**
- `anima_Umi_jelly-fish.png` is in `/assets/` with a typo in the prefix (`anima_` not `animal_`). Manifest correctly skips it. When renamed, write a bio (`/docs/characters/Umi.md`) and place Umi somewhere — probably an upcoming underwater scene.
- No `music_*` or `sfx_*` assets yet. Existing scenes already reference `sfx_pop`, `sfx_chime`, `sfx_step` and `music_calm`, `music_curious` by key — when these land they'll wire automatically.
- The `cosy-cottage-interior` scene's hotspots assume a fireplace/window exist in roughly the upper-left and upper-middle of the painting. If the actual painting differs, retune coordinates.
- `mountain-lake-vista` needs a `peep_painter` or `thing_easel` to fully sell the "two paintings of the same place" theme — see `docs/scenes/mountain-lake-vista.md` for the design hook.

## 2026-05-08 — Initial scaffolding

**Touched:** entire repo (greenfield).
**Added:**
- Vite + Phaser 3 project with `npm run dev / build / preview / check-coverage`.
- Asset manifest plugin (`/src/plugins/manifestPlugin.js`) that walks `/assets/` recursively, parses every filename via the contract in CLAUDE.md §3, and writes `/src/content/manifest.json`. Watches in dev for hot reload.
- Core systems: `AssetLoader`, `AssetManifest`, `HotspotManager` (with hover halo + click-cycling + 1-in-7 rare responses), `DialogueBox` (auto-positions, auto-dismisses, reduced-motion aware), `AudioManager` (crossfading music + SFX, mute), `Accessibility` (mute / reduced-motion / text-size persisted to localStorage), `SceneRouter` (fade-through transitions, soft history, home button).
- Scenes: `BootScene` (preloads everything, friendly progress bar), `WaitingScene` (placeholder when no `bg_*` assets exist yet), `GameScene` (generic scene driver — bg, things, characters with idle bob/sway, hotspots, remix overlays).
- Persistent `GlobalUIScene` for corner controls (home, mute, reduced-motion, text-size).
- Content layer: empty `scenes.js`/`characters.js` ready for hand-authored entries; full generic rhyme pool in `lines.js` (per-region + per-theme); `autoScene.js` builds a playable scene for any `bg_*` without a designed entry, so dropping in a fresh background is never a dead wall.
- Docs: `WRITING_STYLE.md`, `HOTSPOT_PATTERNS.md`, `THEME_COVERAGE.md`, `PLAYTEST_NOTES.md`.
- `scripts/check-coverage.js` to flag any unused asset against scenes.js + characters.js.
- OpenSpec initialised at `/openspec`.

**Open hooks for next agent:**
- `/src/content/scenes.js` is empty — once real `bg_*` assets land, replace each auto-generated scene with bespoke hotspots, remixes, and theme tags.
- `/src/content/characters.js` is empty — write a bio + 5+ dialogue lines for each `peep_*` and `animal_*` sprite.
- Wire up `thing_*` sprites that look like wearable hats into rare-response remixes per `Hotspot Patterns: thing-becomes-hat`.
- The reduced-motion settings round-trip is implemented but never UI-tested with real motion content. Verify before MVP.
- `npm install` not yet run on this machine.
